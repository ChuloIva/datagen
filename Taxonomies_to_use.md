## **1. Bloom's Taxonomy (1956, revised 2001)**

The most widely used framework in education, originally with six cognitive levels: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. The revised version uses active verbs: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create.

**Revised Bloom's Cognitive Process Dimension:**
- Remembering (recognizing, recalling)
- Understanding (interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, explaining)
- Applying (executing, implementing)
- Analyzing (differentiating, organizing, attributing)
- Evaluating (checking, critiquing)
- Creating (generating, planning, producing)

## **2. Guilford's Structure of Intellect (1967)**

Guilford proposed intelligence consists of three dimensions with 180 different components. The Operations dimension includes six cognitive processes: Cognition (understanding and awareness), Memory Recording (encoding), Memory Retention (recall), Divergent Production (generating multiple solutions), Convergent Production (finding single solutions), and Evaluation (making judgments).

**Guilford's Operations (Cognitive Processes):**
- **Cognition** - understanding, comprehending, discovering, becoming aware
- **Memory Recording** - encoding information
- **Memory Retention** - recalling information  
- **Divergent Production** - generating multiple solutions, creativity
- **Convergent Production** - deducing single correct solutions
- **Evaluation** - making judgments about information

## **3. Metacognitive Processes Framework**

Metacognition involves awareness and regulation of one's thinking. It includes three main components: Metacognitive Knowledge (declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge), Metacognitive Regulation (planning, monitoring, evaluating), and Metacognitive Experiences (reflections from previous learning).

**Metacognitive Operations:**
- **Metacognitive Knowledge**: declarative (knowing what), procedural (knowing how), conditional (knowing when/why)
- **Metacognitive Monitoring**: tracking comprehension, evaluating progress
- **Metacognitive Regulation**: planning strategies, adjusting approaches
- **Meta-awareness**: noticing your own thought processes
- **Self-questioning**: interrogating your understanding

## **4. Basic Cognitive Processes (Contemporary Cognitive Psychology)**

Contemporary cognitive psychology identifies core processes including: Perception (organizing sensory information), Attention (prioritizing specific aspects), Memory (retaining and retrieving information), Thinking (reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making), and Metacognition (monitoring and regulating mental processes).

**Core Mental Operations:**
- Perception and pattern recognition
- Attention and selective focus
- Encoding and retrieval
- Categorization and classification
- Reasoning (deductive, inductive, analogical)
- Problem-solving
- Decision-making
- Concept formation
- Mental imagery

## **5. Piaget's Mental Operations**

Jean Piaget identified specific mental operations in cognitive development including: Seriation (ordering by characteristics), Transitivity (recognizing logical relationships), Classification (identifying sets), Decentration (considering multiple aspects), and Reversibility (mental reversal of actions).

Your list aligns well with these scientific frameworks, particularly touching on:
- **Metacognitive operations** (reconsidering beliefs, meta-cognitive reflection, suspending judgment)
- **Divergent/convergent thinking** (generating hypotheses, counterfactual reasoning)
- **Cognitive reframing** (reframing situations, reappraising emotions, taking perspectives)
- **Analytical operations** (distinguishing concepts, abstracting, making concrete, connecting ideas)
- **Pattern recognition** (noticing patterns, recognizing recurring patterns)
- **Mental model updating** (updating mental models, accepting and letting go)
