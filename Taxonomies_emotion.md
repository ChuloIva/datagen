Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about emotional taxonomies. Let me provide you with a complete answer:

## **Emotional/Affective Taxonomies**

### **1. Krathwohl's Affective Domain (1964)**

The Affective Domain, developed by Krathwohl, Bloom, and Masia in 1964, addresses emotions, feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms, motivations, and attitudes. It has five hierarchical levels: Receiving (awareness and attention), Responding (active participation), Valuing (attaching worth), Organizing (integrating values), and Characterizing (internalizing values to guide behavior).

**The Five Levels:**

1. **Receiving** (awareness)
   - Listening attentively
   - Being aware of feelings/emotions
   - Willingness to hear
   - Attending to information

2. **Responding** (reaction)
   - Actively participating
   - Complying with expectations
   - Showing interest
   - Reacting to stimuli

3. **Valuing** (worth)
   - Attaching value to objects/ideas
   - Expressing preferences
   - Demonstrating commitment
   - Appreciating

4. **Organizing** (conceptualizing)
   - Comparing values
   - Resolving conflicts between values
   - Integrating into personal value system
   - Building internal consistency

5. **Characterizing** (internalizing)
   - Acting consistently with values
   - Developing a philosophy of life
   - Self-reliance and internal motivation
   - Values guide all behavior

### **2. Gross's Process Model of Emotion Regulation**

The Process Model identifies five families of emotion regulation strategies based on when they intervene in the emotion generation process: Situation Selection (choosing to avoid/approach emotional situations), Situation Modification (altering the situation), Attentional Deployment (directing attention), Cognitive Change (reappraising meaning), and Response Modulation (modifying emotional responses).

**Five Emotion Regulation Strategies:**

1. **Situation Selection**
   - Choosing to approach/avoid situations
   - Deciding which contexts to enter
   - Anticipating emotional consequences

2. **Situation Modification**
   - Changing the situation itself
   - Altering external circumstances
   - Modifying the environment

3. **Attentional Deployment**
   - Distraction
   - Concentration
   - Mindfulness
   - Rumination vs. redirection

4. **Cognitive Change (Reappraisal)**
   - Reinterpreting meaning
   - Reframing situations
   - Taking different perspectives
   - Distancing (temporal, spatial, objective)

5. **Response Modulation**
   - Suppression
   - Expression modification
   - Physiological regulation (breathing)
   - Behavioral control

### **3. Emotional Intelligence Models**

The Mayer-Salovey ability model defines emotional intelligence as four abilities: Perceiving Emotions (detecting emotions in faces, voices, and oneself), Using Emotions (generating emotions to assist thought), Understanding Emotions (comprehending emotional knowledge), and Managing Emotions (regulating emotions in self and others).

**Mayer-Salovey Four-Branch Model:**

1. **Perceiving Emotions**
   - Identifying emotions in faces, voices, body language
   - Recognizing own emotions
   - Detecting emotional content in art, music

2. **Using Emotions to Facilitate Thought**
   - Generating emotions to aid cognition
   - Directing attention based on feelings
   - Using mood swings for different perspectives

3. **Understanding Emotions**
   - Comprehending emotional vocabulary
   - Understanding emotion transitions
   - Recognizing complex feelings
   - Predicting emotional trajectories

4. **Managing Emotions**
   - Regulating emotions in self
   - Regulating emotions in others
   - Opening to pleasant/unpleasant feelings
   - Engaging/detaching from emotions reflectively

**Goleman's Five Domains:**
- Self-awareness
- Self-regulation
- Motivation
- Empathy
- Social skills

## **How to Integrate Emotions into Your List**

You could organize your cognitive and emotional operations like this:

```python
mental_operations = {
    "cognitive": [
        "reconsidering a belief",
        "reframing a situation",
        "noticing a pattern",
        "questioning an assumption",
        "abstracting from specifics",
        "making something concrete",
        "connecting disparate ideas",
        "distinguishing between concepts",
        "updating a mental model",
        "suspending judgment",
        "zooming out for context",
        "focusing on details",
        "drawing an analogy",
        "counterfactual reasoning",
        "generating hypotheses",
        "meta-cognitive reflection"
    ],
    
    "affective": [
        "receiving/noticing an emotion",
        "acknowledging feelings",
        "responding to emotions",
        "valuing emotional experiences",
        "reappraising emotions",
        "accepting emotions without judgment",
        "sitting with discomfort",
        "choosing emotional responses",
        "modulating emotional expression",
        "distancing from intense feelings",
        "generating helpful emotions",
        "understanding emotional complexity",
        "integrating conflicting feelings",
        "aligning emotions with values",
        "cultivating emotional states"
    ],
    
    "perspective_taking": [
        "taking another's perspective",
        "imagining future self",
        "viewing from third-person",
        "considering multiple viewpoints",
        "temporal distancing (time perspective)",
        "spatial distancing",
        "objective observer stance"
    ],
    
    "metacognitive": [
        "monitoring comprehension",
        "evaluating strategy effectiveness",
        "planning approach",
        "recognizing knowledge gaps",
        "self-questioning",
        "meta-awareness of thought"
    ]
}
```

The scientific frameworks show that **emotions and cognition are deeply intertwined** but can be separated for analysis. Your original list captures many cognitive reappraisal strategies that sit at the intersection of cognition and emotion!
