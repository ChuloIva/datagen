# Dataset Generation Instructions for Cognitive Action Training Data

## OBJECTIVE
Generate a dataset of 100,000+ examples demonstrating explicit cognitive and psychological actions/operations. Each example should show internal mental processes like reconsidering, reframing, perspective-shifting, noticing patterns, etc.

## PHASE 1: SEED GENERATION (Target: 20,000 examples)

### Round 1: Core Cognitive Actions (20 batches × 500 examples = 10,000 examples)

For each cognitive action below, generate 500 diverse examples (1-4 sentences each):

**Batch 1: Reconsidering**
Generate 500 examples showing someone reconsidering a belief, decision, or assumption. Vary:
- What's being reconsidered (beliefs, decisions, judgments, assumptions)
- Why they're reconsidering (new evidence, feedback, time passing, consequences)
- Domains (personal, work, creative, scientific, social, moral)
- Outcome (change mind, strengthen original view, suspend judgment)

Example format:
- "I thought Sarah was being dismissive, but I'm reconsidering—maybe she was just overwhelmed that day."
- "Initially I planned to quit, but reconsidering the financial implications, I'll give it six more months."

**Batch 2: Reframing**
Generate 500 examples of reframing situations, problems, or experiences from one perspective to another.
- Show the OLD frame and the NEW frame explicitly
- Include emotional reframes (threat → challenge, failure → learning)
- Include conceptual reframes (problem → opportunity, constraint → creative parameter)

**Batch 3: Noticing/Observing**
Generate 500 examples of someone noticing something they hadn't seen before (patterns, feelings, assumptions, dynamics).
- Use phrases like "I notice," "I'm seeing," "It occurs to me," "I'm aware that"
- Include noticing internal states, external patterns, contradictions, connections

**Batch 4: Perspective-Taking**
Generate 500 examples of shifting to another person's viewpoint or another temporal perspective.
- "How would X see this?"
- "How will I see this in 5 years?"
- "From their position..."
- Third-person view of self

**Batch 5: Questioning/Doubting**
Generate 500 examples of self-questioning, expressing uncertainty, or productive doubt.
- "What if I'm wrong about...?"
- "I'm not sure that..."
- "Is it possible that...?"
- "What am I assuming here?"

**Batch 6: Abstracting**
Generate 500 examples of generalizing from specific to abstract patterns.
- "This isn't just about X, it's really about Y"
- "The pattern I'm seeing is..."
- "At a higher level, this is..."

**Batch 7: Concretizing**
Generate 500 examples of moving from abstract to concrete/specific.
- "What would that actually look like?"
- "Specifically, that means..."
- "A concrete example would be..."

**Batch 8: Connecting/Integrating**
Generate 500 examples of connecting disparate ideas, experiences, or information.
- "This relates to..."
- "I'm seeing a connection between..."
- "This integrates with..."

**Batch 9: Distinguishing/Separating**
Generate 500 examples of differentiating concepts or experiences previously conflated.
- "I used to lump these together, but actually..."
- "There's a distinction between..."
- "These seem similar but differ in..."

**Batch 10: Updating Beliefs**
Generate 500 examples of explicitly updating mental models or beliefs.
- "I used to think X, now I think Y because Z"
- "My model was incomplete; I'm adding..."
- "That evidence shifts my view from... to..."

**Batch 11: Suspending Judgment**
Generate 500 examples of deliberately withholding conclusion or staying with uncertainty.
- "I'm holding this question open"
- "Not deciding yet until..."
- "Sitting with the ambiguity"

**Batch 12: Pattern Recognition**
Generate 500 examples of recognizing patterns across situations.
- "This keeps happening when..."
- "I'm noticing a pattern where..."
- "This is similar to when..."

**Batch 13: Zooming Out**
Generate 500 examples of taking a broader, more contextual view.
- "In the bigger picture..."
- "Stepping back, I see..."
- "From a systems view..."

**Batch 14: Zooming In**
Generate 500 examples of focusing on details or specific aspects.
- "Looking more closely at..."
- "The specific mechanism here is..."
- "Drilling down into..."

**Batch 15: Emotional Reappraisal**
Generate 500 examples of reinterpreting emotional meaning.
- "I felt X, but I'm realizing it's actually Y"
- "What I labeled as anxiety might be excitement"
- "This anger might be covering hurt"

**Batch 16: Analogical Thinking**
Generate 500 examples of mapping one domain to another.
- "This is like when..."
- "By analogy to..."
- "If I think of this as..., then..."

**Batch 17: Counterfactual Reasoning**
Generate 500 examples of "what if" thinking.

### Round 2: Cognitive Action Combinations (10,000 examples)

Generate 10,000 examples that show 2-3 cognitive actions in sequence:

**Example structures:**
- "First I noticed [X], which made me reconsider [Y], leading me to reframe it as [Z]"
- "I was questioning [X], then I zoomed out and recognized the pattern [Y]"
- "After suspending judgment for a while, I'm starting to distinguish between [A] and [B]"

Generate across these combination types:
- Notice → Reconsider (1000 examples)
- Reframe → Update belief (1000 examples)
- Question → Hypothesis generation (1000 examples)
- Zoom out → Pattern recognition (1000 examples)
- Perspective-take → Emotional reappraisal (1000 examples)
- Abstract → Connect (1000 examples)
- Notice → Distinguish (1000 examples)
- Reconsider → Accept (1000 examples)
- Zoom in → Concretize (1000 examples)
- Mixed chains (1000 examples)

## PHASE 2: DOMAIN VARIATION (Target: 30,000 examples)

Take 30 examples from Phase 1 (one from each cognitive action type). For each example, create 1000 variations by changing the domain:

**Domains to vary across:**
1. Personal relationships (romantic, family, friendships)
2. Professional/career decisions
3. Creative problems (writing, art, design)
4. Scientific/technical reasoning
5. Moral/ethical dilemmas
6. Health/wellness decisions
7. Financial choices
8. Learning/education contexts
9. Conflict resolution
10. Identity/self-concept
11. Political/social issues
12. Time management
13. Communication challenges
14. Goal setting and achievement
15. Loss and grief
16. Success and achievement
17. Daily mundane decisions
18. Philosophical questions
19. Parenting/caregiving
20. Personal growth/therapy contexts

For each seed example, maintain the cognitive action structure but transplant it into each domain.

---

## PHASE 3: COMPLEXITY & PERSPECTIVE VARIATION (Target: 30,000 examples)

Take 30 seed examples and create 1000 variations each by varying:

### Complexity levels:
- **Simple:** Single clear cognitive action, straightforward context
- **Moderate:** Multiple factors, some ambiguity
- **Complex:** Multiple interacting cognitive actions, high uncertainty, conflicting considerations

### Perspective variations:
- **First-person immediate:** "I'm noticing right now..."
- **First-person reflective:** "I realized later that I had been..."
- **First-person future:** "I'll need to reconsider when..."
- **Second-person coaching:** "You might try reframing..."
- **Third-person observation:** "She reconsidered her approach..."
- **Internal monologue:** Stream of consciousness style
- **Metacognitive commentary:** Explicitly describing the cognitive process

### Emotional valence:
- Positive contexts (success, joy, connection)
- Negative contexts (failure, conflict, loss)
- Neutral/mundane contexts
- Mixed emotions

### Certainty levels:
- High confidence in the cognitive action
- Tentative, exploratory
- Uncertain, questioning the process itself

---

## PHASE 4: NEGATIVE EXAMPLES (Target: 10,000 examples)

Generate examples that show the ABSENCE or OPPOSITE of cognitive actions:

- Refusing to reconsider despite evidence
- Rigidly maintaining one frame
- Not noticing obvious patterns
- Inability to take other perspectives
- Certainty without questioning
- Missing connections
- Over-generalizing without distinction
- Updating beliefs without sufficient evidence
- Premature judgment without suspension

These help the SAE learn what is NOT a cognitive action.

---

## PHASE 5: DIALOGUE FORMAT (Target: 10,000 examples)

Generate dialogues (2-6 exchanges) where cognitive actions are demonstrated:

**Therapy/coaching contexts:**
- Client: [shares situation]
- Therapist: "What if you reframed that as..."
- Client: "Oh, I hadn't considered... I'm reconsidering my assumption that..."

**Peer discussions:**
- Person A: [shares view]
- Person B: "Have you considered... [perspective-taking]"
- Person A: "I see what you mean. I'm noticing I was..."

**Internal dialogue:**
- Part 1: [initial thought]
- Part 2: [questioning/reconsidering]
- Part 1: [updating belief]

---

## PHASE 6: THOUGHT-STREAM FORMAT (Target: 10,000 examples)

Generate stream-of-consciousness examples that show cognitive processes unfolding:

"Okay so I'm feeling frustrated about this conversation... wait, I'm noticing that frustration... is it really frustration or is it more like disappointment? Let me reconsider what happened. She said X, and I interpreted that as Y, but what if she meant Z? From her perspective, she might have been... yeah, okay, reframing this: it's not that she doesn't care, it's that we have different communication styles..."

Generate across various lengths (50-300 words) and various levels of self-awareness.

- [ ] Context is clear enough to understand
- [ ] Diversity in vocabulary (not just repeating "I reconsider" 100 times)
- [ ] Mix of explicit and implicit demonstrations
- [ ] Realistic scenarios and language patterns

## EXECUTION NOTES

- Generate in batches of 500-1000 to maintain quality
- Aim for maximum diversity within each batch
- Don't repeat scenarios or phrasings too closely
- Include various cultural contexts, ages, life situations
- Balance between explicit labeling ("I'm reconsidering") and implicit demonstration
- Review periodically to ensure cognitive actions remain central focus

**TOTAL TARGET: 100,000+ examples**
