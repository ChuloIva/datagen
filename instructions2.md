Ah, you're absolutely right! You need a **prompt template system** that programmatically generates unique prompts for each call. Here's how to build that:

## PROMPT GENERATION SYSTEM

### Core Architecture

```python
# Pseudocode structure
templates = load_templates()
variables = load_variable_pools()

for i in range(100000):
    # Randomly select components
    cognitive_action = random.choice(cognitive_actions)
    domain = random.choice(domains)
    context_detail = random.choice(context_details[domain])
    prompt_template = random.choice(templates[cognitive_action])
    
    # Inject variables into template
    prompt = prompt_template.format(
        domain=domain,
        context=context_detail,
        subject=random.choice(subjects),
        emotional_state=random.choice(emotional_states),
        trigger=random.choice(triggers),
        etc...
    )
    
    # Add uniqueness constraints
    prompt += f"\n\nMake this example unique by focusing on: {random.choice(unique_angles)}"
    prompt += f"\nUse language style: {random.choice(language_styles)}"
    prompt += f"\nExample #{i+1} of this batch."
    
    # Send to LLM
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
```

## COMPLETE PROMPT TEMPLATE LIBRARY

### Template Structure

Each prompt should combine:
1. **Cognitive action** (what to demonstrate)
2. **Specific scenario** (concrete situation)
3. **Constraint/variation** (what makes THIS example unique)
4. **Format instruction** (how to structure it)

## COMBINATION TEMPLATES (For Cognitive Action Chains)

```
TEMPLATE: Chain Prompt
Generate 1 example (3-6 sentences) showing this sequence of cognitive actions:

Step 1: {COGNITIVE_ACTION_1} triggered by {TRIGGER}
Step 2: This leads to {COGNITIVE_ACTION_2}
Step 3: Which results in {COGNITIVE_ACTION_3}

Context:
- Domain: {DOMAIN}
- Scenario: {CONTEXT_DETAIL}
- Subject: {SUBJECT}
- Emotional arc: {STARTING_EMOTION} ‚Üí {ENDING_EMOTION}

Requirements:
- Show clear progression between steps
- Make causal connections visible
- Complexity: {COMPLEXITY}
- Unique constraint: {UNIQUE_ANGLE}
- Avoid these transitions: {AVOID_TRANSITIONS}

Output only the example text, no preamble.
```

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Option 1: Pure Random Combination
```python
def generate_unique_prompt(iteration_number):
    template = random.choice(prompt_templates)
    
    params = {
        'COGNITIVE_ACTION': random.choice(cognitive_actions),
        'DOMAIN': random.choice(domains),
        'SUBJECT': random.choice(subjects),
        'TRIGGER': random.choice(triggers),
        'EMOTIONAL_STATE': random.choice(emotional_states),
        'LANGUAGE_STYLE': random.choice(language_styles),
        'UNIQUE_ANGLE': random.choice(unique_angles),
        'COMPLEXITY_LEVEL': random.choice(['simple', 'moderate', 'complex']),
        'PERSPECTIVE_TYPE': random.choice(perspectives),
        'FORBIDDEN_WORDS': random.sample(all_forbidden_words, 3),
        'ITERATION': iteration_number
    }
    
    # Get specific context for domain
    domain = params['DOMAIN']
    params['CONTEXT_DETAIL'] = random.choice(context_details[domain])
    
    # Format the template
    prompt = template.format(**params)
    
    # Add iteration number to ensure uniqueness
    prompt += f"\n\nExample #{iteration_number}. Make this distinctly different from previous examples."
    
    return prompt
```

### Option 2: Stratified Sampling (Better Distribution)
```python
def generate_stratified_prompts(total_examples=100000):
    prompts = []
    
    # Ensure even distribution across cognitive actions
    examples_per_action = total_examples // len(cognitive_actions)
    
    for action in cognitive_actions:
        for i in range(examples_per_action):
            template = random.choice(prompt_templates)
            
            # Force this cognitive action
            params = {
                'COGNITIVE_ACTION': action,
                # Randomize everything else
                'DOMAIN': random.choice(domains),
                'SUBJECT': random.choice(subjects),
                # ... etc
            }
            
            prompt = template.format(**params)
            prompts.append(prompt)
    
    # Shuffle to avoid clustering
    random.shuffle(prompts)
    return prompts
```

### Option 3: Constraint-Based (Ensure Coverage)
```python
# Create a coverage matrix
coverage = {
    action: {
        domain: 0 for domain in domains
    } for action in cognitive_actions
}

def generate_with_coverage_tracking(total_examples):
    prompts = []
    
    for i in range(total_examples):
        # Find under-represented combinations
        min_coverage = min(min(domains.values()) 
                          for domains in coverage.values())
        
        # Select action/domain that need coverage
        candidates = []
        for action, domains_dict in coverage.items():
            for domain, count in domains_dict.items():
                if count == min_coverage:
                    candidates.append((action, domain))
        
        action, domain = random.choice(candidates)
        
        # Generate prompt with these constraints
        prompt = create_prompt(
            cognitive_action=action,
            domain=domain,
            # randomize other parameters
        )
        
        prompts.append(prompt)
        coverage[action][domain] += 1
    
    return prompts
```

## COPY-PASTE READY: SINGLE MEGA-PROMPT GENERATOR

Here's a ready-to-use prompt you can copy to an LLM:

```
You are a prompt generator. Generate 1 unique prompt that will be used to create a training example for a cognitive action dataset.

Use this template structure:
"Generate 1 example (2-4 sentences) showing {COGNITIVE_ACTION} in this scenario: {SCENARIO}. Requirements: {CONSTRAINTS}"

Randomly select from these options:

COGNITIVE_ACTIONS: [reconsidering, reframing, noticing patterns, perspective-taking, questioning assumptions, abstracting, concretizing, connecting ideas, distinguishing concepts, updating beliefs, suspending judgment, pattern recognition, zooming out, zooming in, emotional reappraisal, analogical thinking, counterfactual reasoning, hypothesis generation, meta-awareness, accepting]

SUBJECTS: [a developer, a parent, a student, a manager, an artist, a researcher, someone in their 20s, someone in their 60s, a team leader, an entrepreneur, a teacher, a therapist, a writer, a scientist, a career changer, someone grieving, a friend, a partner, someone alone, a person in therapy]

DOMAINS: [relationships, career, creative work, research, ethics, health, finance, education, conflict, identity, parenting, communication, goals, failure, success, daily life, philosophy, team dynamics, time management, personal growth]

TRIGGERS: [feedback received, noticing emotion, conversation, setback, success, seeing others' view, quiet reflection, deadline pressure, repeated pattern, challenging question, journaling, new information, time passing, feeling stuck, physical sensation]

CONTEXTS (pick appropriate for domain): [after difficult conversation, pattern noticed, considering reconnection, processing feedback, feeling excluded, boundary issue, misunderstanding, repeated conflict, job offer received, negative feedback, project failure, considering career change, imposter syndrome, work-life balance]

ANGLES: [include sensory detail, show process taking time, include self-doubt, show partial shift, include resistance, make it mundane, specific location, another person's influence, bodily awareness, frame as question, show what's NOT happening, mixed feelings, include metaphor, during activity, temporal framing]

LANGUAGE_STYLES: [casual, introspective, direct, tentative, confident, stream-of-consciousness, analytical, emotional, minimalist, detailed]

Generate the prompt now with randomly selected values from each category. Number it as #{ITERATION}. Include instruction to avoid repetitive phrases and make it unique.
```

Then you use the OUTPUT of this meta-prompt as the input to generate your actual training examples!
